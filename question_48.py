# Question 48 (0.5 pts)
#
# For load case 5, calculate the shear force V_yLC5(x) at x=7.2ft.
#
# Provide your answer in lbs up to 2 places of decimals.
#
# Hint:
#
# Load case 5 (+3g pull-up) includes both the lift load and the effects of inertia.
# The calculations will involve the lift distribution along with the inertia (dead load:
# fuel and bomb, ignoring self weight for now) due to the load factor.
#
# To account for the effect of 3g during this load case, you need to scale your loads
# by factor of 3.
